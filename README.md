# Fish Bowl

An attempt to recreate a classic game with flutter.

## Builds

- [Web app](https://teejstroyer.github.io/fish_bowl_game)

## Game Setup

1. Assemble 2 teams.
2. Decide how many Person/Place/Things to be entered per person. (eg. Lebron James, Honda Accord, John Wick)
3. Each player will enter their *N* number of **unique** Person/Place/Things. Then select ***NEXT PLAYER*** and pass the phone.
4. Once every player has contributed their entries. The game can begin.

## Game Rules

- There are 3 rounds. **Same objective for each round**.
- Get your team to guess whats on the card in the alloted amount of time.
- Alternate teams until the round is complete; ie. no cards remain.
- Once no cards remain, shuffle the cards and start the next round.
- Each time you switch teams, a different teammate should be playing.
- The team with the most cards that were guessed correctly at the end of 3 rounds wins.
- Each player can continue drawing until time runs out for their turn.
- *If there is time left on a players turn after completing the round, they get to start the next round with the remaining time*

### Rounds

- **Round 1:** You can say anything but whats on the card.
- **Round 2:** You have to act out whats on the card without talking.
- **Round 3:** You can only say one word, and it can't be on the card. *Any sound or filler word like **"um"** counts. You must be silent after making any noise.*
